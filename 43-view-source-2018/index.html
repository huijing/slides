            <p>Hello everyone! Wow, this has been such an amazing conference, and I feel so privileged to be sharing the stage with all these wonderful speakers. I've recently been in London proper for the first time about a month ago.</p>
            <p>Honestly I thought I had been to London before. I'd gone through Heathrow so many times I could tell you where the toilets were, where to charge your stuff… Until someone pointed out that wasn't exactly having “been to London”.</p>

              <p>Bruce Lee was the most impactful martial artist of this generation. His legendary fighting prowess translated well onto the silver screen, where he became an iconic kung-fu superstar.</p>
              <p>But he was also a deeply self-reflective man, who developed profound philosophical insights about the world around him and life itself.</p>

              <p>Content on the web behaves just like water. Rather than trying to wrangle every pixel into place, we need embrace the fact that content is meant to flow. When you freeze water into ice, it can no longer flow into containers of different shapes and sizes.</p>
              <p>Content that is fixed can only look good on specific screens. Also, if I throw a ball of ice at you, it's gonna hurt.</p>

Couldn't walk, couldn't understand most instructions. Did whatever I felt like doing. Sort of like how browsers were back in the day.</p>
              <p>But as the years passed, browser capabilities advanced. Mine did too. I developed the ability to run, throw a ball, even drive a car. I could also now understand much more complicated instructions than before.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Bootstrap, which is arguably the most popular front-end framework around, originally started out as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools within Twitter. When its creators released it as an open source project in 2011, it really took off.</p>
              <p>It wasn't long before other frameworks started to pop up as well. What frameworks offer are a set of pre-written styles that developers can use to build out apps or sites by applying the relevant CSS classes. These frameworks provide consistent options for things like layouts, UI elements, interactions and so on.</p>

              <p>Consistent, but limited. Frameworks themselves are not a problem. It's a great concept, but only if the framework is built and developed to cater to the requirements for the project in question.</p>
              <p>There may be a number of use-cases for adopting an off-the-shelf framework, but if we choose to learn a framework, and learn it well, all we get is the ability to manoeuvre within the bounds of the framework.</p>
              <p>In this day and age, browsers are constantly being updated with new features and bug fixes. The web is ever changing, at odds with the fixed patterns of frameworks.</p>

            <aside class="notes">Support for feature queries is really good, with coverage in over 90% of browsers, even Opera Mini. The only browsers that don't support it are Internet Explorer and Blackberry Mobile. And that's actually not too big of an issue.</aside>

@supports (property:value) {
  .selector {
    /* Styles for browsers that support the specified property */
  }
}</code></pre>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>This is how a feature query looks like. It's a conditional that checks if the browser supports a particular property or not. If it doesn't, the entire block within the <code>@supports</code> rule is ignored.</p>
              <p>This means we start off with the basic layout that works everywhere. It could be a float-based layout, or even single column, maybe largely browser default UI elements, that sort of thing. Then we layer on styles based on the features we want to use.</p>
              <p>By organising our code in this manner, both browsers that do not support feature queries, or the specified properties will still get styled. Albeit a more basic style. The newer browsers will get enhanced layouts, if they support some or all the newer features within each feature query.</p>

              <p>However, we need to keep in mind that the web is a different medium from print. Just like there are some things print can do that the web can't, there are numerous things the web can do that print can't either.</p>
              <p>Often, with CSS, there are multiple ways to achieve the same effect, however, the amount of effort required depends on whether we choose the right tool for the job.</p>

              <p>On a narrow screen, it's not that feasible to use diagonals given the limited space, but on a wider layout, it turns out pretty well. For browsers that don't support Transforms, we can still present a layout that doesn't use those properties with the help of feature queries.</p>

              <p>With 3D transforms, we are operating with one more axis, which is the z-axis, for depth. So there are some additional properties like <code>backface-visibility</code> and <code>perspective</code>, for example. The <code>perspective</code> property controls how far an element appears to recede into the horizon. The smaller the value, the more dramatic the 3D effect is.</p>
              <p>So if I change the value of <code>perspective</code> here to something smaller, you can see that the horizon recedes much further away.</p>

            <p>A major evolution in web layout is the ability to position and align content in both the inline and block directions.</p>
            <p>Alignment along the inline axis was generally well supported from the start, especially for languages that were read horizontally from top-to-bottom. Moving text or blocks of content horizontally wasn't too complicated, we had <code>text-align</code>, we could use auto-margins to centre blocks.</p>
            <p>But vertical alignment required a lot of workarounds, a lot of hacks and frustration. Luckily, CSS is not a fixed technology. Changes were introduced, improvements were made, and now we have a suite of tools for two-dimensional alignment and layout.</p>

              <p>Because flex formatting contexts can operate in both dimensions, the auto-margins technique makes centring components much less painful.</p>
              <p>Any positive free space will be distributed to auto margins in their respective dimensions. So if I set a <code>margin-left: auto</code>, Boxie here ends up all the way on the other end of the container. And if I do a <code>margin-top: auto</code>, Boxie gets sent all the way down.</p>
              <p>If we don't specify a dimension, then any free space will be equally distributed on either side of the flex item. And I love showing this example to people who have just started out with CSS and ran into a wall when it comes to centring items.</p>

              <p>A common issue I hear is that it's difficult to create a grid system with Flexbox. The thing about Flexbox is, even though you can make a grid system with it, it's not the best tool for building a grid system.</p>
              <p>Items in a flex formatting context are aware of each other in a single dimension, either vertically or horizontally. When flex items of equal width wrap to the next line, it may seem like we get rows and columns, but there is no relationship between flex items stacked on top of each other.</p>
              <p>Does that mean you can't use flexbox to layout large numbers of items? Not at all.</p>

                <p>Here, I have a list of images. Once I apply <code>display: flex</code>, all the items are shrunk and laid out in a single row. If I turn on wrap, they all revert to their original size and wrap down to the following row if there's insufficient space on the current flex line.</p>
                <p>I'll turn on the border so you can see how each flex child behaves. Now instead of the initial behaviour of shrink but not grow, I'll change it to grow but don't shrink and make the images take up the width of the child container. Now we can play with alignment.</p>
                <p>I can do an <code>align-items: center</code> and create this jagged look. But maybe we want it a bit neater. We can do that by standardising the height of the flex children. But this makes the aspect ratio screwed up, so a compromise could be cropping off the taller images with the <code>object-fit</code> property.</p>

                <p>I can also change the direction of the layout by setting <code>flex-direction</code> to <code>column</code> and giving the container a defined height. Now I've got this horizontal scroll going on.</p>
                <p>And again, we can play with alignment. Now that the flex direction has changed, the block and inline axes have also changed. <code>justify-content</code> now shifts along the vertical axis, while <code>align-items</code> shifts along the horizontal axis.</p>
                <p>But maybe we don't want all those gaps. Remove the alignment code, make the flex children totally flexible and images fill up their containers' heights. Using <code>calc()</code> allows me to account for the margins of each image with respect to their container heights. Let's fix the standardise the widths of all the images.</p>
                <p>Such layouts are a demonstration of what Flexbox can do out-of-the-box. They are not hacks. These are native options that we have when it comes to designing our layouts.</p>

                <p>In this example, I have asked the browser to make me columns that are at least 150px wide, but can grow if free space permits. Currently, the keyword set to <code>auto-fill</code>. The available space can contain 8 columns. Even though I didn't have enough grid items to fill up the last 2 columns, those columns still take up space.</p>
                <p>When I change it to <code>auto-fit</code>, the last 2 columns are collapsed and the columns that do contain grid items grow to fill up the empty space.</p>

                <p>Let's put it all together. Now, we're telling the browser that when the viewport size shrinks, to cap the shrink of each column at 10ems but if there's extra space, grow all the columns equally.</p>
                <p>By using auto-fill (or auto-fit), the browser will calculate how many columns fulfil the requirement. When the viewport size changes, the number of columns will decrease or increase until everything fits.</p>
                <p>And because the maximum value is a flexible unit, if there is an excess of space, all the columns will grow equally to fill up that extra space, so there will never be awkward whitespace on the sides at any point.</p>

                <p>One more thing I want to mention is the concept of an implicit grid. The explicit grid is the one we define using <code>grid-template-columns</code> and <code>grid-template-rows</code>. But there's nothing stopping us from placing an item outside the bounds of this grid. What happens then?</p>
                <p>I've defined a 3x2 grid here, but there are more than 6 grid items. The browser then generates implicit rows and columns to hold the extra items.</p>
                <p>The explicit grid column lines here only go up to 4, but if I place an item on line 6, the browser generates 3 more implicit columns so my item can be placed accordingly. These columns take up enough space to hold the items' content, but we can adjust this with the <code>grid-auto-*</code> properties.</p>

              <p>The <code>grid-auto-flow</code> property lets us adjust the direction and density of grid items. When your layout consists of items of varying sizes, you end up with gaps in between them, and some of them are rather large gaps.</p>
              <p>What we can do is add the <code>dense</code> keyword, to pack in those gaps with any items that can fit.</p>
              <p>We can also use the <code>column</code> value to switch up the direction of flow. Let me change up some values, and voila, a horizontal scrolling layout. We can also pack them close if we want to.</p>

              <p>I have a trick for remembering which property affects which axis. So are these icons familiar to most of you? These show up in almost any rich-text editors, and we use them to <strong>justify</strong>> text.</p>
              <p>That is, to move text along its inline axis. Now there are only 2 values for 2 axis, so if justify is along this direction, then align must be for the other direction.</p>

              <p>For flexbox, <code>justify-content</code> helps distribute free space left over after flexible lengths and auto margins are resolved. If you can see here, the items don't quite fill up to the right edge.</p>
              <p>The initial value is <code>flex-start</code> but we can position the content with <code>flex-end</code> and <code>center</code>, as well as distribute the space between flex items, using <code>space-around</code>, <code>space-between</code> and <code>space-evenly</code>.</p>
              <p>And because we have multiple flex lines in this container, <code>align-content</code> can be used to manage space along the cross-axis. The default value for this is <code>stretch</code>, so flex lines in single-line containers stretch to take up all the space.</p>
              <p>So we can use the same values to pack and align flex lines within the flex container, or distribute space between flex lines.</p>
