            <p>Hello everybody. Welcome to CityJS. Thank you for being here on this lovely Friday morning. I'm not sure why the organisers put me in the opening slot because there's really not a lot of Javascript going on in my talk. So maybe that's why.</p>
            <p>All of you clearly paid money to see the hard-hitting hardcore Javascript rockstars later in the day, but you need to warm up first. That's what opening acts are for. Like how Paramore opened for Taylor Swift, right?</p>

            <p>Because this is the Singapore edition of CityJS, I feel obliged to stay true to the culture. For the benefit of the audience who are unfamiliar with English spoken in Singapore, there is a range. Best explained in a graphical form. FYI, this is a legitimate HTML range input. Come ask me how it's built later.</p>
            <p>So today, I will try to keep the level somewhere in the middle of Queen's english, and extreme Singlish. In general, the “R” sound sometimes becomes “L”, like ready will may sound like leddy. Also, the “ver” sound may often just be omiited. Like, government, will become gahmen. Or nevermind, will become nehmind. Also, grammar is optional.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>There is no canonical set-in-stone definition of i18n, but the W3C does offer this guidance. It is designing and developing in a way that enables easy localisation for specific audiences. Localisation covers a broad range of customisations including but not limited to: numerals, time and date formats, currencies, symbols, icons and colours, even textual and graphical references.</p>
            <p>This implies that i18n is a lot more than simply translating the content on a site to different languages. There are nuances to the presentation of that content which will affect the experience of a native speaker using your site.</p>

            <p>Let's talk about numbers. Specifically large numbers. I am Chinese, so I can only talk about this numeral system here. But there are also other languages that have specific words for powers of the base. Like India has lakh for 100 thousand and crore for 10 million.</p>
            <p>For us, we have a word for 10,000, 万, and after that it goes up by power 4. So the next word is for 100 million, which is 亿. So 1 billion is 9 zeroes, and we don't have a specific word for that.</p>

            <p>Translation strings are a way for us to mark strings to be extracted from the source code to be passed over to translators to translate.</p>

            <p>This was not a problem for the most part, in fact, there was only 1 instance where a problem arose. Because the number returned for <code>{total_gmv_billions}</code> was 200. I don't know who made the decision, but I'm betting the person only spoke English? I don't know, man.</p>

          <p style="max-width:26em;text-align:left;margin:auto">Saying that the GMV is 200 ten million dollars is quite a glaring grammatical error, if you speak the language.</p>

            <p>Definitely not the translators fault that the end result is like this because if I put myself in their shoes, and I see a variable for X billion. I would intuitively think it's like oh maybe 5 or 6 billion. They didn't know the number was 200.</p>
            <p>But regardless, a mistake is a mistake. Users don't care why, they only see that we made a rookie error.</p>

          <h2>But why didn't Japan have this problem? 🤯</h2>
          <img data-src="img/billion-ja.png">
          <div class="fragment">
            <p>The Japanese team had worked around this issue previously by editing the locale files that reference our total GMV numbers like so:</p>
            <pre class="language-yml" style="width:max-content;font-size:1em"><code style="white-space:pre-wrap">%{total_gmv_billions}0億米ドル</code></pre>
            <p>Our Japan team spotted this error and made the adjustment of replacing 十 with a 0.</p>
          </div>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>It was actually a Korean language reviewer who was meant to review some other content that flagged this to us. They were like, I know you told us only to look at the designated section, but this is too glaring to ignore.</p>
            <p>When I got the ticket, I was like, the other CJK locales must have this also. But only the Chinese site got. Japan was fine. Because back then, our Japan team was quite stacked with native Japanese speakers. And they manually went into the translation file to replace the character for 十 (juu) with a 0. Perfect.</p>

%{total_gmv_billions}0 亿美元
%{total_gmv_billions}0 億美元</code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>So of course I just stole it for the fix. Another thing that tends to get overlooked is spaces between words or characters. Again, I can only talk about the CJK languages because I don't know about others.</p>
            <p>For Chinese, there is no space between characters, but there is usually a space between a Chinese character and a non-Chinese character. Korean has its own spacing rules, called 띄어쓰기 (ttiosseugi).</p>
            <p>This is important when dealing with translation strings and interpolation because sometimes the spaces literally get lost in translation.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Interpolation is super useful but needs to be done very deliberately. Other than what I described earlier, things like pluralization can also become an issue. There are six plural forms identified in the Unicode Common Locale Repository, for zero, one, two, few, many and other. Some languages also have gendered nouns.</p>
            <p>The point is, hard-coding word order or trying to manipulate text at the code level tends to make translation very difficult to get right. The folks that built and maintain the i18n libraries have done a lot of the tricky work for us, so it's probably a good idea to use those tried and tested packages, like for Javascript, we have <code>i18next</code> which exists in many popular framework flavours.</p>

          <aside class="notes">Not sure if everyone is familiar with Unicode, but it is a standard for character encoding. And the Unicode Consortium's mission statement is that everyone in the world should be able to use their own language on phones and computers. In general, characters for a particular script are found in defined Unicode ranges. For example, Thai is from 0E00 to 0E7F.</aside>

            <li>Latin-1 Supplement {U+0080..U+00FF}</li>

          <aside class="notes">Vietnamese is interesting, because the current writing system uses the 29-letter Latin-script based Vietnamese alphabet. It is tricky because the Vietnamese alphabets exist across several non-contiguous Unicode ranges. Because designing fonts is a lot of work, most fonts are not going to support every single Unicode range in the universe. Even the Latin-based scripts probably cover until Latin-1 Supplement, unless they explicitly want to support specific languages.</aside>

          <h2>Missing Vietnamese glyphs</h2>
          <img data-src="img/vietnamese.png" style="max-height:90vh">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>So when choosing web fonts for your project, make sure to check the font's language support, otherwise, you might end up with the situation where missing glyphs look very obvious on your site. This situation occurs because when the browser cannot find a corresponding glyph in your chosen font to represent a character, it will use a fallback font that has that glyph.</p>
            <p>If your fallback font doesn't really match well to your chosen font, then it will become like this. And I am aware that some people cannot tell if there is a problem here. But the point is I can tell, it's glaring to me, and I think this shouldn't happen. It looks unprofessional.</p>

          <h2>The <code>:lang()</code> pseudo-class</h2>
          <pre style="width:max-content;font-size:xx-large">
            <code>:lang(vi) {
  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif;
}</code>
          </pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Some products have commissioned fonts, and those are really quite expensive, so you're probably going to want to use them in as many places as possible. And that's totally justifiable. So we can use an alternative font stack only for those languages that your font doesn't support. CSS lets you do that.</p>
            <p>Basic web development best practice is that you must declare a <code>lang</code> attribute. If you want to know why, come ask me later, I explain to you. Assuming you (or most likely your framework) dutifully set the <code>lang</code> attribute, you can use this pseudo-class to target only Vietnamese content. And provide an appropriate alternative font stack that fits your branding and all that.</p>

          <h2>Issue with Apple SD Gothic Neo</h2>
          <img data-src="img/kr-font.png">
          <pre style="width:max-content;font-size:xx-large"><code>:lang(ko) {
  font-family: 'Work Sans', -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, sans-serif;
}</code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Since we've talked about commissioned fonts, this one is a bit of an edge-case, I would think. It has to do with Apple's choice of default font for Korean. Most CJK fonts will also have a Latin-based character set simply because we cannot escape from English on the web. That's just how it is. But anyway, Apple uses Apple SD Gothic Neo for Korean.</p>
            <p>I discovered that it does not have support for the Latin-1 Supplement range, which means that we end up with a blasphemous situation where Beyoncé would not render correctly. Sacrilegious. For cases like this, specifying the Latin-based font first would fix it, even if that font doesn't have Korean language support because then the default fallback Korean will trigger for the Hangul characters. And everything will render properly. Talk to your designers about crafting a nice font stack.</p>
