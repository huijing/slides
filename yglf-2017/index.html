    <title>When East meets West: web typography and how it can inspire modern layouts</title>
    <meta name="description" content="This talk traces the parallel history of western and eastern typography from handwriting to the internet age, setting the context for how the web is a brand new medium for typesetting. CSS allows us to implement advanced typographic features and multi-directional layouts, that not only benefits internationalisation, but opens up a myriad of options for creative and interesting layouts in general as well.">

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Someone once asked me this question, do developers even care about typography? I think they do. But maybe I'm wrong. How many of you think typography is important?</p>
              <p>Typography has always been an integral part of Human-Computer Interaction and software design. There is a very good reason why Apple has an entire section dedicated to Typography in the Apple Developers' Human Interface Guidelines.</p>
              <p>You might disagree with me, but as a front-end developer, the code we write impacts how our sites or applications look, so we too have a share of the responsibility in the design of our products.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Oliver Reichenstein said in his article back in 2006, that “Web design is 95% typography”. And he reiterated that the web as a medium, is all about information.</p>
              <p>Textual content is the most straightforward method of delivering information on the web. And whether we like it or not, Typography is increasingly becoming what differentiates a good website from bad.</p>
              <p>Let's be honest, people are superficial and have short attention spans these days. The typography, layout and design of a site or application are like the clothes you wear. And people make judgements off their first impressions of you or your site based on what they see.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>There are many definitions of Typography out there, and I personally like this one, by Gerrit Noordzij. Letters are the building blocks of a writing system, regardless of language. Now I want you to think about the languages you're familiar with, which I assume is Hebrew and English. Both of these are alphabetic languages.</p>
              <p>Israel is a world leader in technology and innovation, with a robust startup scene. So it is no wonder that Chinese investments in Israeli startups exceeded $500 million in 2015. Earlier this year, Israel and Japan signed 2 agreements in Jerusalem that would increase collaboration on both business and cyber-security ventures in the hopes it would double the trade volume between both countries.</p>
              <p>There's a bit of an East-Asian relationship developing here. So you can think of this talk as providing a little bit of cultural exchange. Now I'm going share about an East Asian language that I am very familiar with, which is Chinese.</p>

              <p>Chinese is not alphabetic. It is a logographic writing system. Each Chinese character is composed within a uniform square, allowing Chinese to be read efficiently, regardless of whether it is set horizontally or vertically.</p>
              <p>And until proven otherwise, it seems that the Chinese script developed separately from the Proto-Sinaitic scripts which were the origins of alphabetic languages.</p>

              <p>Which is why the Western languages in Europe are inherently different from the Eastern languages in Asia.

              <p>Chinese characters, on the other hand, number in the tens of thousands. Each a unique glyph that can express meaning on their own or be used in combination with other glyphs.</p>

              <p>Take the Latin alphabet for example, which is derived from Greek. The earliest letters were sans-serif when writing was done with a hard reed pen. Serifs may have came about due to a transition to a square-cut writing implement, like a flat stiff brush.</p>

              <p>The web isn't even 30 yet, and this young medium is like nothing we've seen before. It is dynamic and interactive. Some designers, especially those who are used to having absolute control over their final presentations, find this behaviour disturbing.</p>
              <p>Although it may be tempting to view the web as simply print expressed on an electronic screen, it is not. It is a unique medium of its own.</p>

              <p>A glyph is the specific shape of a letter or character in a particular font. In the digital world, everything is data. So glyphs can be described with an array of pixels, or collections of vector images or even paths of Bézier curves and straight lines.</p>
              <p>Different font formats store information about the font, like their glyphs, encodings, metadata about the font etc., differently based on how their specifications were written.</p>

              <p>If you've ever used web fonts before, you would have seen these font formats. Have you wondered why there are so many? We'll need to go a bit back in time for this. The earliest fonts were pixel-based bitmaps, which were fine for low-resolution screens, but for printing on high-resolution printers, a better solution was needed.</p>
              <p>It was such a worthy problem that smart people came up with two different solutions. Donald Knuth created Metafont in 1978 for the TeX system, which generated compressed bitmap fonts. John Warnock, founder of Adobe, came up with Postscript in 1985, the very first vector font, and it really took off.</p>
              <p>TrueType was Apple and Microsoft's answer to Adobe's font monopoly. Both companies then worked separately to improve TrueType, especially with regards to fonts for East Asian writing systems. Eventually, Microsoft turned to Adobe and together they came up with OpenType.</p>
              <p>EOT, or embedded OpenType is Microsoft's proprietary standard, which is a compact form of OpenType fonts meant for use on web pages. Although they tried to submit this as a W3C recommendation, it was rejected in favour of WOFF, or the Web Open Font Format. WOFF2 is an improvement over WOFF with significantly better compression rates.</p>

              <p>And these, as mentioned earlier, are font descriptors, and only the <code>font-family</code> descriptor and the <code>src</code> descriptor are mandatory.</p>
              <p>If either of them are absent, the entire <code>@font-face</code> rule is ignored. The <code>font-family</code> descriptor is simply a label that we reference in other CSS declarations. So even if you're using say, Frutiger, you could actually call it “Kreplach” and it would still work.</p>
              <p>The <code>src</code> descriptor is comma-separated list of external references or locally-installed font face names. It is made up of the declaration of the font file's location, and an optional format hint. If the browser doesn't support a particular font format stated in that hint, the font file won't be loaded.</p>
              <p>The next 3 descriptors, for style, weight and stretch, are used to match styles to a particular typeface in later declarations. Technically, you could assign a black typeface to a font-weight of 100 and proceed to confuse your team members who cannot figure out why setting a weight of 100 gives them this massively bold typeface. Perhaps an idea for next year's April Fool's day.</p>

              <p>Font feature properties were introduced in Fonts Level 3. Modern font technologies allow fonts to contain a lot more glyphs that before. So we can utilise a variety of typographic features like swashes, ligatures, old-style numerals and so on.</p>
              <p>Perhaps some of you may be wondering, what's the point of having all these typographic features?</p>
              <p>They are part and parcel of good typography, which is necessary to hold your reader's attention. The written word is a transference of speech, which is heard, into something visual, to be seen. Good speakers will vary their cadence, use gestures, emphasise certain words.</p>
              <p>Typographic features like small caps, correct use of italics and punctuation do the same for text. Other features like old style numerals and ligatures help maintain typographic colour, to make reading more comfortable.</p>
              <p>So these are the features you can turn on via CSS, but note that the font you are using must have these features to begin with. This lot up there, are the features most often mentioned at web typography talks.</p>

              <p>Few people talk about <code>font-variant-east-asian</code>. What this property does is allow for glyph substitution and positioning in East Asian text. If you're unfamiliar with Han characters, it might seem like these languages share the same glyphs, but it depends. Han unification involves assigning the same code point to different glyphs, and it has been quite a controversial issue.</p>
              <p>We won't get into that, but the point is, the same code point can have variant glyphs depending on the language being used. Like, simplified Chinese glyphs versus traditional Chinese glyphs. Japanese has its own specification, and they too have alternate glyphs for the same character. This property allows us to toggle these variant glyphs.</p>

              <p><code>font-feature-settings</code> allows us to toggle very specific OpenType properties. Last I checked, there were 141 OpenType feature tags to cover things like vertical kerning, unicase, scientific inferiors and so on.</p>
              <p>Browser support for each of <code>font-variant</code> properties varies at the moment, with Firefox being the only browser that has supported all of them since version 34.0.</p>
              <p><code>font-feature-settings</code>, on the other hand, has quite good support across most browsers. Although, the specification recommends to utilise the respective <code>font-variant</code> properties, until browser support becomes more robust, I suppose we'll continue to see <code>font-feature-settings</code> being used instead.</p>

              <p>Within the short span of the web's life, we've seen web layouts evolve as browser technologies and web standards matured. In the web's infancy, there was no layout whatsoever. We were still amazed that the web even existed.</p>
              <p>Then, during the pre-school age of the web, we started to use tables to do layout. And that was fun, because like most kindergarteners, everything seemed like a good idea. There were all sorts of crazy, creative layouts on the web.</p>
              <p>But when we got to the pre-teen era, things started to conform a little more. We got a bit more self-concious, a little less radical, it wasn't that cool to be different. Float-based layouts to build sites with headers, sidebars and footers were the most socially acceptable.</p>
              <p>By high school, life had gotten complicated, and angsty. CSS was hard. Responsive design, what? People suck. Browsers are broken. Oh, someone will do all that for me? Frameworks? Sure! I don't give a crap. So we ended up with sites that utilised very similar layouts.</p>

              <p>But something big happened this year. CSS Grid was released. CSS Grid is a revolutionary feature that was designed specifically for doing layout on the web.</p>
              <p>All the other techniques we've used in the past, HTML tables, floats, even flexbox, were never meant for doing full page layouts. They were creative hacks we came up with to build the layouts that we wanted.</p>
              <p>So this is the year web layouts come of age. We now have a level of control over how elements are rendered on the browser that we've never had before, with CSS grid. And when used in combination with other properties, like CSS shapes, transforms, viewport units and so on, the design possibilities become endless.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>One more relevant property is <code>text-combine-upright</code>. This addresses the issue of numerals and abbreviations in vertical text. A very common use case is dates, especially for Taiwan, where they use the 民國 calendar. This property lets us fit all the digits into the width of one character and display them upright.</p>
              <p>No browser supports the digits value yet, which allows us to dictate how many digits are acceptable to be squeezed in this one-character width. The range allowed is between 2 to 4 characters. For now, with the <code>all</code> value, there is no limit, so you could put in a world like hippopotamus and it will just look horribly squished.</p>

              <p>Laying out content in a different direction does require a change in perspective. And I gleaned quite a few insights from working with vertical layout. For example, the techniques I was so used to for centring items worked a bit differently with a vertical layout.</p>
              <p>To vertically centre a block, setting the top and bottom margins to <code>auto</code> actually does work, unlike in horizontal writing, which is great. But trying to centre something horizontally is an exercise in pain.</p>

              <p style="font-size:75%;text-align:left;">If Jackson Pollock was the public face of the New York avant-garde, Willem de Kooning could be described as an artist’s artist, who was perceived by many of his peers as its leader. He was born in Rotterdam, where he grew up in an impoverished household and attended the Rotterdam Academy, training in fine and commercial arts. In 1926, the adventurous young artist stowed away on a ship bound for Argentina. While the ship was docked in Virginia, de Kooning slipped off, skirted immigration, and made his way to New Jersey—and so began the rest of his life.</p>

            <aside class="notes">That's why we have a CSS Logical Properties specification, which introduces new CSS properties that are flow-relative equivalents of physical box model properties. Properties like that use <code>block-start</code> and <code>block-end</code> or <code>inline-start</code> and <code>inline-end</code> instead of left and right. This specification is in the thick of working draft status but I'm eager to see it developed and implemented. For now, support is kind of limited.</aside>

              <p>I had built a layout for displaying Chinese text with a toggle that allowed readers to switch between vertical and horizontal layouts. And it wasn't as straightforward as I thought it would be.</p>

              <p>For example, you can make a bookshelf style list of posts with just CSS. Something like this can be done by applying a <code>vertical-rl</code> to each list item, plus some padding and inset box-shadows for the visual effect.</p>
              <p>Another idea is for headers. For horizontal languages, you wouldn't layout long chunks of text vertically because that just makes it hard to read. But using vertical text for short titles or headers can break up the monotony of a long page.</p>

Perhaps you have realised that the hamburger menu is not the best mobile UI pattern we came with. Depending on the number of links in your navigation, laying them out vertically along the side edge could be a design worth considering. And I'm sure many of you can come up with even more interesting designs that utilise vertical layouts.</aside>

            <aside class="notes">Statistically, there aren't that many sites which use the <code>writing-mode</code> property. When I started building vertical layouts, Grid hadn't landed yet, so I used Flexbox for a lot of the layout. Flexbox support is great, I mean, it has wider coverage than <code>border-radius</code>, but Flexbox with <code>writing-mode</code>? Not so good. I'll be honest, there are quite a large number of cross browser issues. Like, on Firefox, if you don't specify a width on the element with a vertical writing mode, it gets kicked off the page.</aside>

              <p>But that doesn't mean we should just shy away from using vertical text altogether. In fact, there's never been a better time than now to live on the cutting edge. Evergreen browsers are a thing now, with bug fixes and new features being shipped faster than ever.</p>
              <p>CSS Grid, I feel, is one of the best rollouts of a new major CSS feature ever, with almost all the major browsers shipping it in March this year. By now, more than 75% of the market is using a browser that supports Grid.</p>
              <p>And here's a little secret I discovered, by raising bugs we find when trying out new features, we are actually showing browser vendors that these features are in demand.</p>
              <p>This works both ways, if we don't use features simply because they are buggy, browser vendors will think that nobody really cares about that feature and choose to fix more pressing bugs instead. But if more of us use those features and raise the bugs we discover, it sends a signal to browser vendors that people are using these features and encourage them to address related bugs sooner than later.</p>
