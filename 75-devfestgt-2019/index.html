            <p>Hello, everyone! First of all, I want to the thank the organising team of DevFest Georgetown for bringing me home. And thank you all for being here today. I need to thank you all up front because recently, I've been a little upset when I think about CSS. Upset because CSS is becoming more and more awesome, but it seems as though people still think it's this limited, broken thing that doesn't work properly.</p>
            <p>I don't know about the rest of you, but I was one of those people who loved CSS from the start. So much so that I tried doing everything in pure CSS if I could. Now that I'm slightly less immature, I realised that it wasn't the best idea, but it did make me very familiar with how CSS worked.</p>
            <p>Then somehow, I got sort of involved a bit more with the folks who build browsers and develop web standards, and found the entire process very fascinating, and I wanted to share what I learned with all of you.</p>

              <p>The World Wide Web turned 30 years old this year back in March. Maybe this is considered ancient for some of you, but if you think about it, this technology that almost all of us use everyday, is really quite young.</p>
              <p>If we think about other mediums for transmitting knowledge and information, print has had thousands of years to develop. The telephone, from its mechanical predecessors till today, also had hundreds of years to evolve.</p>

              <p>So when the web started out, there was no layout. You could format your text with spaces, line breaks and indents, sure. But having a designed visual layout on your web page? Nope.</p>
              <p>The first time we could sort of place things in specific positions on a webpage was probably 👾 in 1994 when <code>table</code> elements were supported in browsers. Originally meant for people to make data tables, they were soon misused for layouts. Because developers discovered… 👾 nesting.</p>
              <p>Then 👾 CSS came along in 1996, and with it came floats. And we learned a new way to layout elements on their page. 👾 But floats weren't easy to deal with. Columns were uneven heights, things got displaced and didn't line up, you had to clear stuff. 👾</p>
              <p>And because it was so hard, 👾 some people decided to build frameworks, and let everyone else apply these pre-written styles with CSS classes. This approach was really popular and we hit an age where a lot of websites had very similar layouts.</p>
              <p>👾 But during that time, CSS also started to have properties that were designed to suit the web better, to suit the fact that content on the web is very different from any other static medium.</p>

              <p>Think of CSS as an evolving technology. It started out in 1996 as a long monolithic document, and at the time, browser vendors treated the implementation of CSS a bit like how we Malaysians treat traffic laws. We take them as suggestions rather than rules.</p>
              <p>The CSS Working Group was created in 1997 to tackle issues which were not addressed in the first version of CSS and they have been working on improving and evolving CSS ever since.</p>
              <p>By 2000, CSS had been broken up into modules to clarify the relationships between different parts of the specification, and make it easier to test, update and maintain the specification as a whole.</p>
              <p>The 2018 CSS Snapshot released in January this year now consists of 99 modules, many of which are being actively worked on.</p>

              <p>Individual CSS properties can be quite useful on their own, but the full power of CSS truly shines through when we use different properties in combination.</p>
              <p>For example, this highlighted subset consists of modules that are layout-related, but there are so many others as well. Some are completely new, some are enhancements on older features.</p>
              <p>Today, I'm going to focus mostly on CSS for layouts. Not only because I genuinely enjoy moving boxes around on the page, but also, I feel it's one of those aspects of CSS where the evolution is most ah-maz-ing.</p>

              <p>Maybe some of you are thinking, that can't be true. All our content on the web has always been in two dimensions already, right? Well, even though the content sort of flowed in two dimensions, we had very limited control along the block direction.</p>
              <p>Rachel Andrew, who is one of the major contributors to the CSS grid specification, describes Grid liddat. Grid works from the container in, while other layout methods start with the item first. Okay, example time.</p>

              <p>People will raise questions about certain use-cases, or highlight issues with syntax, with logic, with implementation details, and so on. It's not a quick nor easy process.

              <li class="fragment">Numerous proposals submitted that were never implemented</li class="fragment">
              <li class="fragment">First proposal that stuck was one from <strong>Microsoft</strong> (for Metro UI)</li>
              <li class="fragment">First implementation of Grid ever was in <strong>IE10</strong> (with vendor prefix)</li>
              <li class="fragment"><strong>Bloomberg</strong> hired <strong>Igalia</strong> to implement CSS grid for <strong>Blink</strong> and <strong>WebKit</strong></li>
              <li class="fragment"><strong>Rachel Andrew</strong> proposed <code>gap</code> to solve the gutter problem</li>
            </ul>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>And here are a few fun facts from the CSS grid story. As the quote earlier mentioned, grid-based layouts were a goal from the start, and many proposals were submitted, just never implemented. The first one which led to an initial implementation was from Microsoft, hence the first implementation came in IE10.</p>
              <p>Bloomberg was actually sponsored Igalia, a Spanish open source consultancy, to implement CSS grid for Blink and Webkit. So we have them to thank for Grid in Chrome and Safari. Also, there would be no <code>gap</code> property if it weren't for Rachel Andrew.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>I'll also be referring to some grid-specific terms later, so we'll cover them here. Grid lines are the horizontal and vertical lines that form the basis of the grid structure. We use a numerical index to reference the lines, and the index starts from 1. Like Lua, not C.</p>
              <p>Each space between grid lines are called grid tracks, these are the rows and columns of your grid, and represent the spaces your items appear in.</p>
              <p>The grid cell is a single unit of the grid and is made up of 2 adjacent row lines and 2 adjacent column lines. By default, each grid item is 1 grid cell. Many grid cells become grid area.</p>
              <p>The best part about Grid are grid gaps, which let us add space between grid tracks. No need for awkward negative margins and padding tricks. This feature has been expanded to flex layouts as well, so if you're using Firefox 63 and beyond, you can gap your flex items too.</p>

              <p>Some of us might not be too familiar the the levels in CSS specifications. Long story short, the CSS spec used to be a big monolithic document for the first 2 versions, but was split up into modules in 2000 to make it easier to test, develop and maintain the specification.</p>
              <p>This split up version was commonly referred to as CSS3. But there is and will never be CSS4 or 5 and so on, because each CSS feature is a separate document now. Usually when a feature gets too complicated, or something in there requires more discussion, it gets deferred to the next level.</p>
              <p>Subgrid was an important feature from the start, but it needed more time to ensure robustness, hence it was deferred to Level 2. So level 2 of the grid specification covers 👾 subgrid, as well as 👾 defines the behaviour for aspect-ratio-controlled gutters. But we'll only focus on subgrid right now.</p>

              <p>Or if you wanted to align inline form inputs and their labels.</p>

And whenever you come across a new feature that seems interesting, or might be useful to you, just go ahead and try it out. Build something with it. Anything. Demos don't have to be grand, monetisable side projects. It can even be an excuse to spend hours searching for the most appropriate cat pictures.</p>
            <p>Building demos, writing articles, or even just starting a conversation on Twitter. All this helps build awareness of new CSS features, and act as feedback to browser vendors and specification writers on what developers are looking for out of the web platform.</p>
