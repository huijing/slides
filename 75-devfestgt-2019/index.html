            <p>Hello, everyone! First of all, I want to the thank the organising team of DevFest Georgetown for bringing me home. And thank you all for being here today. I need to thank you all up front because recently, I've been a little upset when I think about CSS. Upset because CSS is becoming more and more awesome, but it seems as though people still think it's this limited, broken thing that doesn't work properly.</p>
            <p>I don't know about the rest of you, but I was one of those people who loved CSS from the start. So much so that I tried doing everything in pure CSS if I could. Now that I'm slightly less immature, I realised that it wasn't the best idea, but it did make me very familiar with how CSS worked.</p>
            <p>Then somehow, I got sort of involved a bit more with the folks who build browsers and develop web standards, and found the entire process very fascinating, and I wanted to share what I learned with all of you.</p>

              <p>The World Wide Web turned 30 years old this year back in March. Maybe this is considered ancient for some of you, but if you think about it, this technology that almost all of us use everyday, is really quite young.</p>

              <p>So when the web started out, there was no layout. You could format your text with spaces, line breaks and indents, sure. But having a designed visual layout on your web page? Nope.</p>
              <p>The first time we could sort of place things in specific positions on a webpage was probably 👾 in 1994 when <code>table</code> elements were supported in browsers. Originally meant for people to make data tables, they were soon misused for layouts. Because developers discovered… 👾 nesting.</p>
              <p>Then 👾 CSS came along in 1996, and with it came floats. And we learned a new way to layout elements on their page. 👾 But floats weren't easy to deal with. Columns were uneven heights, things got displaced and didn't line up, you had to clear stuff. 👾</p>
              <p>And because it was so hard, 👾 some people decided to build frameworks, and let everyone else apply these pre-written styles with CSS classes. This approach was really popular and we hit an age where a lot of websites had very similar layouts.</p>
              <p>But during that time, CSS also started to have properties that were designed to suit the web better, to suit the fact that content on the web is very different from any other static medium.</p>

              <p>Think of CSS as an evolving technology. Yes, it started out in 1996 as a long monolithic document, and at the time, browser vendors treated the implementation of CSS a bit like how we Malaysians treat traffic laws. We take them as suggestions rather than rules.</p>
              <p>The CSS Working Group was created in 1997 to tackle issues which were not addressed in the first version of CSS and they have been working on improving and evolving CSS ever since.</p>
              <p>By 2000, CSS had been broken up into modules to clarify the relationships between different parts of the specification, and make it easier to test, update and maintain the specification as a whole.</p>
              <p>The 2018 CSS Snapshot released in January this year now consists of 99 modules, many of which are being actively worked on.</p>

              <p>Individual CSS properties can be quite useful on their own, but the full power of CSS truly shines through when we use different properties in combination.</p>
              <p>For example, this highlighted subset consists of modules that are layout-related, but there are so many others as well. Some are completely new, some are enhancements on older features.</p>
              <p>Today, I'm going to focus mostly on CSS for layouts. Not only because I genuinely enjoy moving boxes around on the page, but also, I feel it's one of those aspects of CSS where the evolution is most ah-maz-ing.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Later might have some minor jargon, so clarify here first. Grid lines are the horizontal and vertical lines that form the basis of the grid structure. We use a numerical index to reference the lines, and the index starts from 1. Like Lua, not C.</p>
              <p>Each space between grid lines are called grid tracks, these are the rows and columns of your grid, and represent the spaces your items appear in.</p>
              <p>The grid cell is a single unit of the grid and is made up of 2 adjacent row lines and 2 adjacent column lines. By default, each grid item is 1 grid cell. Many grid cells become grid area.</p>
              <p>The best part about Grid, is can have gaps between tracks. No more funny negative margin and paddings sia. This feature has been expanded to flex layouts as well, so if you're using Firefox 63 and beyond, also can use.</p>
