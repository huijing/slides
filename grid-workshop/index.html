    <meta name="description" content="2017 was the year of CSS grid, a powerful tool that was developed specially to do layout on the web. It allows us to do many things that we couldn't before, without extreme measures of hackish-ness. It is definitely not hyperbole to say that CSS grid will revolutionise web design moving forward. This workshop will run through what CSS grid is, how it works and what you can do with it.">

            <p>This workshop assumes you have a reasonably good grasp of CSS, and how to handle specificity and the cascade. That you could write an entire site’s layout in vanilla CSS without any frameworks.</p>
            <p>If you are a bit more novice on the CSS front, no worries, just that the pace might be a little fast. But you can ask our facilitator, Shirlaine, for help if you get really lost.</p>
            <p>Just to get a grasp of the audience today, how many people have used CSS grid before? In production? How many of you use Flexbox day-to-day? And what’s the most common technique you use to build your layouts? Floats? Tables?</p>
            <p>If you ask me, I will always say context matters. That there is never a single way to achieve something, so don’t treat whatever you learn today as dogma, or the ONE WAY. Think of this as adding tools to your CSS toolbox, and it’s up to you to choose the right tool for the right situation.</p>

            <p>Does everybody have Firefox Nightly installed? And I think you all should have received some instructions via email outlining the different ways you can set this up. At the end of the day, everything we are doing is vanilla HTML and CSS. There is nothing extra to install to get your code to work.</p>
            <p>Nightly is recommended so you can make use of the Grid Inspector tool, and the starter kit is merely a workflow that I personally use because I’m too lazy to press Command-Shift-R hundreds of times a day. Like I said, the assumption is that this audience comprises of experienced web developers, so do whatever suits you best.</p>
            <p>At the very least, just have an HTML file and write your styles between &lt;style&gt; tags in the &lt;head&gt;, or ideally in a separate style sheet. CodePen is definitely an option, I just wasn’t sure how stable the internet connection was going to be. Pencil and paper is a plus, you'll see.</p>

              <p>Anybody who worked/works in an agency? How often do you get designs that are very “print”? I believe not all agencies are the same, but very often, as the developer, I ended up with one comp, for desktop, and a bunch of people expecting the website to look exactly like the psd, down to the pixel.</p>
              <p>Sometimes you’d get a comp for the mobile version too, and that usually made my life worse, because the mobile version’s layout isn’t even remotely related to the desktop version with regards to layout.</p>
              <p>I truly believe this is because of a lack of understanding of how the web as a medium works. And I admit, earlier on in my career and life, I wasn’t the best communicator. I was kinda sullen, and would give my designers all varieties of dirty looks. So immature, really.</p>
              <p>Does everyone know how a browser renders elements on the page? If so, just bear with me for a moment, I’ll try to give the abridged version. These graphics are from Lin Clark, author of Code Cartoons, and someone I really look up to in the web industry, and have personally learned a lot from.</p>

            <aside class="notes">HTML and CSS are human-readable (largely), but the rendering engine needs to parse the information into objects the browser can understand. At this point in the rendering process, the DOM knows about how the page is structured and all the parent/child relationships between elements. It just doesn't know HOW those elements should look like yet.</aside>

            <aside class="notes">The different boxes are then painted on screen, and can occur on multiple layers.

          </div>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>When the web started, there was no way to do layout at all, because all browsers could do was display text, or maybe some images, if you were lucky. But as more users started getting online, people started to find new ways to utilise the web and design for it. So properties that were never meant to be used for layout, like HTML tables or floats, were the next best hack we could think of.</p>
            <p>Eventually, this got really painful and people started relying on frameworks to do the heavy lifting, especially when it comes to the layout side of things. In fact, I've inherited a lot of legacy projects that include the entire Boostrap library but only use its grid system.</p>
            <p>This is an overview of how web layouts have evolved over the years. CSS grid gives us a level of control over how elements are rendered on a page that we’ve never had before. And that’s the biggest reason why it is revolutionary.</p>

          <h2>Basic terminology</h2>
          <img style="height:75vh" class="plain" data-src="img/terminology.svg" alt="Grid terminology">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>There are a number of terms I will constantly refer to throughout this workshop, so let’s make sure everyone is on the same page. Grid lines are the horizontal and vertical lines that form the basis of the grid structure, and can be referred to by their numerical index, which starts from 1.</p>
            <p>Each space between grid lines are known as grid tracks, which make up the rows and columns of the grid, and represent the spaces your items appear in.</p>
            <p>The grid cell is a single unit of the grid and is made up of 2 adjacent row lines and 2 adjacent column lines. By default, each grid item takes up 1 grid cell. A grid area is made up of multiple grid cells.</p>
            <p>The best part about Grid, is the ability to define grid gaps, which are the gutters between grid tracks. Fun fact, grid gap wasn't in the original specification until Rachel Andrew championed it during one of her conference talks.</p>
            <p>One of the specification writers was in the audience and they worked together to get this feature into the specification. So the next time you use grid gap, remember you have Rachel Andrew to thank for this excellent feature.</p>

          <aside class="notes">The first concept to wrap our heads around is the fact that Grid, like Flexbox, operates on the parent-child relationship, whereby, the display property is set on the parent element. This then affects the layout of all that elements immediate children.</aside>

          <blockquote>“Grid works from the <strong>container</strong> in, other layout methods start with the <strong>item</strong>”<br><small>—<a href="https://rachelandrew.co.uk/">Rachel Andrew</a></small></blockquote>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>My favourite way to explaining the CSS grid mental model comes from Rachel Andrew, who describes it as such: “Grid works from the container in. All other layout techniques start from the item first.”</p>
            <p>Let’s illustrate this with some simple examples, which will also serve as the introduction to the most basic set up for using CSS grid.</p>

A common use case that fr units can solve is for responsive uniform grids that needs to adjust to the width of the viewport. For layout methods that revolve around the width of the grid item, multiple media queries are necessary because the width of each item has to be explicitly stated depending on the width of the viewport.</p>
              <p>With the fr unit, we are essentially ceding control of the sizing of each grid item to the browser, allowing the browser to figure out how large each grid item should be based on the parameters we provide through the functions made available to us with CSS grid.</p>

              <p>An important part of building web layouts is aligning elements on the page. And box alignment can sometimes trip people up. I know it can be hard to remember which property does what.</p>
              <p>For me, I associate <code>justify</code> with the direction that text flows, because I've been justifying text in Microsoft Word since version 97. And if justify is for inline direction, then align must be for the other direction.</p>

              <p>The <code>justify-content</code> and <code>align-content</code> properties are known as <strong>content-distribution properties</strong>. These properties are relevant when the container is larger than the total width or height of the grid rows and columns.</p>
              <p>As we can see from this example, there is some space to the right and bottom of the grid items. It is possible to set the alignment of the rows and columns with respect to the entire grid container.</p>
              <p>We can position the grid rows and columns within its container using 3 values, <code>start</code>, <code>center</code> and <code>end</code>. We can also adjust the space between rows and columns with <code>space-around</code>, <code>space-between</code> and <code>space-evenly</code>.</p>

              <p>It's probably easier to refer to this table. <code>space-around</code> puts an equal amount of space on both sides of the row or column, so the spaces at the edge of the container will be half of the spaces between inner rows or columns.</p>
              <p><code>space-between</code> distributes all the tracks evenly in the grid container with the first and last rows or columns flush with the edges of the container.</p>
              <p><code>space-evenly</code> is currently only supported in Chrome 60 onwards and Firefox 52 onwards. It distributes the grid tracks evenly within the grid container such that the space between any 2 adjacent grid tracks are the same.</p>
              <p>Is everyone totally lost now? Trust me, it gets easier with experience.</p>
