            <h2>Typography…? 🧐</h2>
            <blockquote class="fragment">“Typography is writing with prefabricated letters”<br><small>—Gerrit Noordzij</small></blockquote>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Even though this is my first typography event, it's safe to say I was interested in typography before I even knew what it was. Or at least, what it was formally defined as. And I don't think there is a standardised definition, and each have their own nuances.</p>
              <p>Personally, I like the one by Gerrit Noordzij, that “Typography is writing with prefabricated letters”. Letters are a type of grapheme, which is the smallest unit of a writing system of any given language.</p>
              <p>A large proportion of the world's writing systems in use today are alphabetic in nature, where a relatively small set of letters can be combined in many different ways to form words, phrases and sentences. Transforming something we hear and say, into something we see and read.</p>
            </aside>

          <section data-background-image="img/directions.jpg">
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>But Chinese is different. Chinese is currently the only logographic writing system left that is widely used by millions of people. Each Han character is composed within a uniform square, allowing Chinese to be read efficiently, regardless of whether it is set horizontally or vertically.</p>
              <p>And until proven otherwise, it seems that the Chinese language was an indigenous invention, developed separately from the Proto-Sinaitic scripts which were the origins of alphabetic languages.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>The nature of writing systems for Western languages in Europe are fairly distinct from those used in East Asia. The Phoenician alphabet is considered the origin of many alphabetic writing systems on which the Greek, Latin and Roman alphabets were based on. With alphabets, you have a small set of letters used in a myriad of combinations to form all the words you would use to communicate with another person.</p>
              <p>With Han characters, we have thousands upon thousands of unique glyphs that can express meaning on their own or be used in combination with other glyphs. This has a direct consequence on the structure of the language itself.</p>

            <aside class="notes">Alphabetic languages form words using combinations of letters, sometimes we end up with really long words. Chinese is more concise, and often the meaning of the word is encompassed within the glyph itself. And that's how we ended up with tens of thousands of characters. But no matter the writing system, the end goal was always to express and record ideas into something concrete.</aside>

              <p>Before we get into the talk proper, where we'll be looking at what current web technologies offer for typesetting in the browser, I'd like everyone to just give a think about information technology. Since we are often said to be living in the information age right now.</p>
              <p>Information technology deals with the storage and retrieval of information, the extraction of higher levels of meaning from a collection of information and the transmission of information over large distances.</p>
              <p>Writing is the first information technology humans ever developed. And writing was so flexible. All you needed was a surface and an implement to create marks on that surface. Vincent Steer, founder of the British Typographers' Guild, had said that the character of any alphabet is dictated by the materials used in its expression.</p>
              <p>Cuneiform writing was made by using a wedge-shaped tool that was pressed into wet clay, the Egyptians wrote on papyrus with a reed pen, making their lines were soft and flowy. Chinese writing centred around the brush, and this too informed how Han characters evolved over time.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Technological advancement can generally be thought of as humanity's solution for producing more output for less effort. The advancement of information technology sought to reproduce writing at scale, from employing larger number of humans to copy scripts to the development of printing and digital technology.</p>
              <p>But with every increase in productivity, significant trade-offs were made. The techniques that won out over the course of human civilisation shape how we live today. There are a huge number of factors that came into play but what is undeniable is that modern day digital technology suits a particular style of writing system over others.</p>
              <p>I have no idea what an alternate history would look like because my reality is here and now. It's as if you're asking a person who has been colour-blind their whole life to imagine what green is. Science fiction writers probably do a better job of this, but I do wonder how different our lives would be if digital technology was pioneered in a different region.</p>

              <p>A glyph is the specific shape of a letter or character in a particular font. In the digital world, where everything is data, glyphs can be described as an array of pixels, or collections of vector images or even paths of Bézier curves and straight lines.</p>

              <p>Fonts are collections of glyphs. In the analogue world of metal typesetting, these are fonts. Some of you may have seen drawers containing individual metal sorts used for letterpress printing.</p>
              <p>In the digital world, these are fonts, specifically font files. All digital files are simply long lists of numbers stored as binary on a storage device. And file formats are what allows us to read and understand the data these numbers represent.</p>
              <p>Different font formats store information about the font, like their glyphs, encodings, metadata about the font and so on, differently based on how their specifications were written.</p>

              <p>As such, there has to be a form of translation performed by the computer so these series of binary numeric values can be rendered on the screen as characters that we can recognise and read. Sequences of bytes are mapped to individual characters according to a key, which is known as character encoding.</p>
              <p>The first encoding standard was the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), which was originally based on the English alphabet and developed from telegraph code, specifically Baudot code, if anybody is interested in history.</p>
              <p>Computer architecture at the time was largely 8-bit, while ASCII encoded characters in 7 bits, for the original 128 characters. There was capacity for another 128 characters and when computers reached countries outside America, everyone did their own thing to cater for their own language and character requirements.</p>

              <p>Writing systems utilising Han characters consist of tens of thousands of glyphs. These were never going to fit into 8 bits. Local encoding systems like the Chinese Guobiao and the Taiwanese Big5 were developed to handle Chinese characters.</p>
              <p>Japan even created multiple systems for Japanese depending on the hardware, but the systems were not compatible with one another. The Japanese even have a term for the garbled output caused by text decoded with an unintended chracter encoding, called Mojibake (文字化け).</p>
              <p>This issue is less pronounced today with the widespread adoption of Unicode, but it is not solved. For example, Burmese text sometimes still doesn't display correctly on Facebook.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Every computer's operating system has a text rendering engine, which is responsible for rasterising the font outlines for display on the screen. Browsers' layout engines will defer to the operating system's text rendering engine. If there are multiple text rendering engines, the browser can pick which to use. This is why text looks different on Mac and Windows, and sometimes even vary on different browsers on the same machine.</p>
              <p>Electronic displays these days are fairly high resolution, but a huge majority of the screens we encounter are raster displays. Which means everything we see on screens are made up of individual discrete pixels. We've just managed to pack a lot more pixels onto a screen than we used to.</p>

              <p>One of the solutions to this problem came from Adobe founder, John Warnock. He had founded Adobe Systems in December 1982, with Charles Geschke. Together with Doug Brotz, Ed Taft and Bill Paxton, they created a page description language called PostScript, which went to market in 1984.</p>
              <p>PostScript was great for printing, but it also handled fonts very well. An issue with fonts at the time was that they did not scale linearly at small sizes. Glyphs would get distorted during scaling, but PostScript handled this by providing additional metadata as font hints.</p>
              <p>This was highly secret technology and the hinted fonts were compressed and encrypted into what Adobe called a Type 1 font, which only stored outline information. The first vector font format, and it did really well on the market.</p>

              <p>TrueType was Apple and Microsoft's answer to Adobe's font monopoly. Both companies then worked separately to improve TrueType, especially with regards to fonts for East Asian writing systems.</p>
              <p>Apple came up with TrueType GX, later renamed Apple Advanced Typography. Microsoft came up with TrueType Open in 1994 and eventually Adobe joined in the effort and together they developed OpenType.</p>
              <p>Microsoft also came up with EOT or embedded OpenType, and tried to submit this as a W3C recommendation. However, it was rejected in favour of WOFF, or the Web Open Font Format.</p>
              <p>WOFF is a font packaging format designed to provide lightweight, easy-to-implement compression of font data. Any properly licensed TrueType/OpenType/Open Font Format can be packaged in WOFF for web use. WOFF2 is an improvement over WOFF with significantly better compression rates.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Designing Chinese characters is significantly more challenging as compared to Latin-based alphabets or Arabic numerals for a number of reasons. Firstly, the sheer volume of glyphs required for just for daily use alone is around 7000, but there are more than 50000 in existence.</p>
              <p>Such a monumental task, if undertaken by a single experienced designer working full time would probably take at least 3 years to complete the 6763 characters defined in the Chinese national standard. Most foundries employ a team working closely together over 3 to 5 months. However, this also increases the risk of inconsistency in structure and style across such a large volume of characters.</p>
              <p>The structure of Chinese characters are also more complex, often having more than 10 strokes and intersection points. Quite a challenge from a rendering perspective as well.</p>

              <p>Joel Spolsky pointed out that Apple and Microsoft have differing philosophies on how fonts ought to be displayed on computer screens. Even though both use sub-pixel rendering to sharpen fonts on lower resolution screens, the major philosophical difference is that Apple believes the goal of the algorithm is to preserve the design of the typeface as much as possible, as the expense of sharpness, while Microsoft generally believes the shape of each letter should be fitted into pixel boundaries to prevent blurriness and improve readability, at the expense of the typeface's original design.</p>
              <p>As such, both operating systems have their own implementations of how text should be rendered on a screen. Tim Brown's series about type rendering on the web demonstrates these differences in a collection of screenshots of text being rendered by these different engines with and without their respective anti-aliasing techniques applied.</p>

            <p><em>Note: <code>font-smooth</code> is a non-standard CSS property. It is also only applicable to Mac OS X / macOS.</em></p>
            <pre><code>-webkit-font-smoothing: auto / none / antialiased / subpixel-antialiased
-moz-osx-font-smoothing: auto / grayscale</code></pre>

              Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, 
              but don't worry, you can <a href="img/font-smooth.mp4">download it</a>
              and watch it with your favourite video player!
            </video>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>I thought this was worth a mention because even though this is not a standard property (it was in the specification in 2002 but removed in the next release). Because it is not standard, the properties are vendor-prefixed, and only apply to Mac OS X and macOS.</p>
              <p>By default, the Webkit engine typically uses subpixel anti-aliasing when it is available. This property allows you to turn off subpixel rendering in favour of a standard anti-aliasing technique for font smoothing, which uses whole pixels to render the font.</p>
              <p>Doing so makes the fonts look thinner and in some contexts sharper, but because there are also cases where doing so will make the text appear more blurry, opinions are mixed on whether this should be used throughout an entire web page or not. For stroke-dense Han characters, the phenomena can be even more pronounced.</p>

            <aside class="notes">When the web first started, browsers could only choose between fonts that were already installed on their users host machines. But in a revision to the CSS specification, a proposal was made for allowing browsers to load fonts from an external source via a URL. This proposal was eventually made a reality when browser vendors picked it up and implemented it.</aside>

              <p>There's an algorithm browsers use to determine which fonts to load and use. And even though it has expanded over the last 2 decades, here's a general idea of what goes on beneath the hood.</p>
              <p>We set the font using a <code>font-family</code> CSS property. For every character the browser encounters, it will match the character with its corresponding glyph in the intended font file, based on its weight and style, and load that particular font file.</p>
              <p>If it cannot find a matching glyph, it will do the same for the next font family on the list, until something does match. If nothing hits, a system fallback font will be used instead.</p>

              <p>Most of the time, system fonts will support an extended character set covering a majority of languages. Which is why the concept of font stacks matter when using web fonts. The order of the declared fonts makes a difference, as the browser goes through them from left to right.</p>
              <p>Ideally, your font stack should be made up of fonts that share similar characteristics, so it is not <strong>that</strong> obvious a fallback has been invoked for a particular missing glyph. Go for similar visual style, x-heights and stroke weights.</p>

              <p>Sometimes you'll see the corresponding character code in a rectangle, or simple a blank rectangle. Personally, I see much less of these, compared to a decade ago, thanks to the widespread use of Unicode.</p>

              <p>Web fonts are implemented in CSS with the <code>@font-face</code> rule, where you can declare a list of different formats for your font of choice. Given the support status these days, it's fairly safe to use just WOFF and WOFF2.</p>
              <p>Though there are many descriptors for declaring a web font with <code>@font-face</code>, only the <code>font-family</code> and <code>src</code>, are mandatory.</p>
              <p>The <code>font-family</code> descriptor works purely like a label, so we can reference the font data via CSS. So maybe you're using Helvetica, you don't have to put “Helvetica” as the descriptor. The <code>src</code> descriptor tells the browser where to find the font data, it could be an external URL, or a local font.</p>

              <p>In terms of browser tools, the Firefox Font Tools is the most full-featured tool you can have right now. A while back, Patrick Brosset, who did a lot of work on the Font Tools, pinged me on Twitter about a feature for detecting missing characters.</p>
              <p>I'm sure he had been thinking and working on it for a bit, but it was still an amazing surprise when he shared his working prototype of the tool the following day.</p>
              <p>The Fonts panel has been around in Firefox for a long time, since version 24. And version 63 shipped with a suite of font tools including the polished version of the font highlighter demonstrated in the above tweets.</p>

              <p>This tool comes in very handy especially for those of you who build multilingual websites or even sites with a handful of foreign words, and you are using a typeface that may not support all the required characters.</p>
              <p>For example, this round sans-serif is Raleway, designed by the League of Moveable Type. It's pretty nice, in my opinion, but unfortunately, does not support Cyrillic characters. Which is a bummer, if I wanted to use it for a talk I'm giving in Ukraine, for example.</p>
              <p>So what we can do, is try to find a font that does contain those characters, and somewhat resembles the design of chosen font, then utilise the <code>unicode-range</code> descriptor to create a “composite font”.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>It's called a composite font because it mixes glyphs from different fonts for different scripts. To deal with the fact that <em>Raleway</em> does not support Cyrillic letters, we can use the <code>unicode-range</code> descriptor to tell the browser to load <em>Comfortaa</em>, which is a font that does, when it encounters any Cyrillic characters.</p>
              <p>Remember that for font-face rules, the font-family is simply a label, so what we've done is create a composite font that uses the name <em>Raleway</em>, but in actuality, loads 2 different font files depending on what characters need to be displayed.</p>

              <p>Most CJK system fonts, short for Chinese, Japanese and Korean, have very good glyph coverage, coming in between 20,000 to 30,000 glyphs. When web fonts were introduced, it allowed developers to send fonts that were not installed on their users' systems via a URL. Font data does take up bandwidth though, and font sizes are dependent on the size of the character set supported by the font.</p>
              <p>The nature of CJK fonts make them impractical from a performance standpoint as web fonts delivered over the internet. Currently, websites in those languages almost always use system fonts because a typical CJK font can go up to around 16mb.</p>

              <p>Variable fonts are a relatively recent development which allow a single font file to contain all the styles and weights the designer intended via variation axes. Developers can then access these options with CSS.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>If the medium we are operating in is the web, then our tool for the trade of typesetting is CSS. We are trying to do what folks have been doing since setting type became a thing, some underlying principles hold steadfast but our tools have changed over time.</p>
              <p>Declaring a content language on an element is one of the most basic things we can do, because it identifies the specific written form of the language to be used in that element, AKA the content writing system.</p>
              <p>This is important because language and writing system conventions affect lots of typographic effects like line breaking, hyphenation, justification, glyph selection and more.</p>
              <p>For CSS, language-specific typographic tailorings are only applied when the content language is explicitly declared. So it is in our best interest to tell the browser exactly what language our content is in to ensure a higher quality typographic experience for our users.</p>

              <p>Earlier, when I talked about all the different font formats, I mentioned that Apple and Microsoft worked to improve the original implementation of TrueType. OpenType and Apple Advanced Typography are what we term modern font technologies, and they can contain a lot more glyphs that previous font formats.</p>
              <p>OpenType fonts can include an expanded character set and layout features, which gives us much broader linguistic support and more precise typographic control. They can also make multilingual typography easier by allowing multiple language character sets in a single font.</p>

              <p>Font feature properties give us access to a variety of typographic features like swashes, ligatures, old-style numerals and so on, if the font we're using contains these features. Which means we can toggle them via CSS.</p>
              <p>Such typographic features are part and parcel of good typography, which is necessary to hold a reader's attention. The written word is a transference of speech, which is heard, into something visual, to be seen. Good speakers will vary their cadence, use gestures, emphasise certain words.</p>
              <p>Typographic features like small caps, correct use of italics and punctuation do the same for text. Other features like old style numerals and ligatures help maintain typographic colour, to make the reading experience more comfortable.</p>

              <p>Most of the time we use <code>text-transform</code> for case adjustments and capitalisation. But it actually does take into account numerous language-specific case mapping rules. For example, the German Eszett ß becomes SS in uppercase, or the Greek vowels lose their accent when the entire word is uppercase. Stuff like that.</p>

              <p>Here we have 5 inline boxes. For now there is enough room so all 5 boxes fit into a single line box. But when there isn't enough room, inline boxes will be broken across line boxes. The break is known as a line break.</p>
              <p>These particular lines were broken due to content wrapping, hence known as a soft wrap break. If wrapping is enabled, the user agent has to minimise the amount of content overflowing a line by wrapping the line at a soft wrap opportunity if one exists.</p>
              <p>For most writing systems, soft wrap opportunities occur at word boundaries, where spaces or punctuation are used to explicitly separate words.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>If you're thinking, breaking lines, how hard can that be? Well, there is a lot of nuance because word breaking works differently depending on the language we're typesetting for.</p>
              <p>For example, English wraps at spaces. But for Japanese or Chinese characters, the break is per character, usually but not always. Becauese line breaks are prohibited before certain punctuation marks. </p>
              <p>A number of Southeast Asian scripts are written without spaces between words, then text is wrapped at syllable boundaries in addition to word boundaries. We could keep going here.</p>
              <p>There is interplay between the 4 properties here to provide developers more precise control over line breaking, because some rules take precedence over others if both are present, or some only take affect if <code>white-space</code> property allows wrapping, for example.</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>Browsers use <strong>language-specific</strong> dictionaries to figure out where the hyphenation points should be.</p>
            <aside class="notes">I highly recommend watching Florian Rivoal, co-editor of the CSS Text specification, explain all of this in his talk at DotCSS. And if you're not sure exactly what's going on, rather confused about all this, just setting the <code>lang</code> attribute will take care of some of this stuff for you.</aside>

              <li>Describes how the inline-level content of a block is aligned along the inline axis if the content does not completely fill the line box.</li>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Text justification is also fairly tricky on the web. Whether we realise it or not, most of us would have encountered 2 major justification algorithms.</p>
              <p>The Greedy algorithm, which analyses only a single line, and the much more advanced Knuth/Plass algorithm which analyses every line in a paragraph. Design software with advanced typesetting capabilities like InDesign use Knuth/Plass. But browsers, sadly, use the simple one. Probably for performance reasons, maybe? I'm not sure.</p>
              <p>Although we don't have a robust justification algorithm, CSS Text Level 3 does include the <code>text-justify</code> property to allow some further tweaking of justified text.</p>

              <p>But when there are both Latin-based alphabets and Chinese characters, it's impossible for everything to line up both vertically and horizontally. The next best thing is to ensure the start and end of every line is aligned well.</p>

            <aside class="notes">The <code>writing-mode</code> property specifically caters for vertical writing on the web. The default is horizontal, top-to-bottom. To change the direction to vertical, we use <code>vertical-rl</code> or <code>vertical-lr</code>. There's a sideways option that's formally been moved to Level 4 but Firefox has it implemented.</aside>
