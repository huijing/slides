# Talk.CSS, 4 years and counting

*For Microsoft Ignite Singapore 2020 (Humans of IT). This is sort of a transcript for the talk.*

So today I'll be sharing about a small community group that I've been heavily involved in for more than 4 years. This group is part of the much larger Singapore tech community but given how small Singapore is (like literally), let's just say, most of us know each other and overlap communities anyway.

As you can see from the title slide, I'm going to be talking about Talk.CSS. Talk is a common English word. I checked the dictionary and it means “speak in order to give information or express ideas or feelings; converse or communicate by spoken words”. But CSS is not a common English word.

What is CSS? For the benefit of anyone who is not familiar with web development, CSS is an acronym for Cascading Stylesheets. Stylesheets are used describe the presentation of a web page by telling the browser how elements on the page ought to be styled and laid out.

It is a stylesheet language, which has its own syntax and rules. As with any community made up of humans, everyone has their own opinion, and that's okay, it's a normal human thing. But naturally, there are also people who have “Opinions”, with a capital O. And some of them have such Opinions about CSS.

There is a sizeable portion of developers out there who regard CSS as inferior, a necessary evil that is not “real programming”, whatever that definition is. The thing about CSS is it FEELS easy at first glance. It's just a bunch of rules, how hard can it be? So it's not surprising that people who jump in expecting things to work a certain way end up angry at CSS when their expectations are not met.

If the world of programming was like high school, CSS would be probably be the nerdy artsy kid who gets bullied a lot, but is oh-so-talented at drawing and stuff. Okay, maybe that was a bad analogy. But that was just a long-winded way to explain that CSS is not exactly winning any popularity contests at large.

Now, let's talk about the Singapore tech community. My first proper web development job was back in 2013 with a small Drupal agency that somehow thought it was a good idea to hire someone who had built all of 2 Drupal websites in their entire life. I'm forever grateful for that. But anyway, given we were a Drupal shop, our bosses were sort of involved with the Drupal meetup group.

Drupal is a content-management framework written in PHP, so the other meetup group I was aware of back then was the PHP user group. And that's how I got to know Michael Cheng, who I was endearingly introduced to as the “Godfather of PHP”. I have since kept calling him 师父, which translates to “master” or “skillful person”.

Personally, I'm a front-end developer, which means I mostly attended meetup groups on web-related technologies. But I also liked hardware and was happy to find out about the maker scene in Singapore as well. Singapore is not a big country.

It is so small that I often find out many of my primary school friends and my JC friends end up knowing each other from University. Back then, there were only 2 options so it's not that surprising. So you can imagine how easy it is for us to find out about other tech meetups whenever we attend one.

webuild.sg was a project by Sayanee Basu and Chinmay Pendharkar which curated a list of all the free public tech events and open source projects in Singapore. It ran from 2013 till 2018 when it merged in with Engineers.SG.

Engineers.SG is a local community initiative started by Michael to answer the question, where are all the engineers in Singapore? He joked that this was clearly a marketing problem, and started his one-man endeavour to record every tech meetup in Singapore he could attend. Because this was crazy, friends joined in to help and it soon became a volunteer group.

We also have things like KopiJS, started by Chee Aun, another local community leader, and Geek Brunch SG, which are really chill meetups where like-minded folks just hang out and don't even have to talk about tech, though we naturally just gravitate toward the subject. And there are so many more across the whole spectrum of tech.

I mention folks by name because at the end of the day, there is no community without individuals who put in time and effort to organise, plan and execute. And these folks, these amazing human beings whom I see as community leaders, have built up something special.

They have established a culture which is warm, inclusive and welcoming. They emphasised the values and ideals of sharing knowledge, of helping each other out and nurturing the local tech community into the vibrant scene that it is today.

SingaporeCSS is merely a beneficiary of such a culture and community. I probably attended my first talk.js back in 2014. SingaporeJS is the local Javascript meetup group which started in 2013 and is still going strong. I also went to the PHP and Drupal meetups, the Ruby meetup for some reason, even though I know nuts about Ruby. They are all web-y, I suppose.

Given now that it is 2020, I doubt anyone even remembers their first encounter with me anymore. But back then, I'd attend meetups, maybe eat a slide of free pizza, listen to the talks, then leave. I almost never start a conversation but I don't mind having one. I recognise and remember faces fairly well though.

Eventually, when you show up at enough meetups, people start to know you and you start to know them as well. I gave my first talk ever in 2015 at talk.js because one of the organisers was a friend of mine, and needed to find speakers. I would soon learn once I became an organiser myself that this will always be THE problem we face.

And what did I talk about at the Javascript meetup? Nothing related to Javascript, that's what. I talked about a HTML element called the `<picture>` element. But there weren't any other frontend-focused meetups other than talk.js, so I guess it was tangentially related enough.

KopiJS, other than a physical meet-up where people chill out and la kopi (which translates to drink coffee), is also an online slack community. It is, until today, one of the slack channels that I'm permanently in, in contrast to the other 50 or so I've never opened since I joined. And one random mid-day on 26 October, 2015, this conversation happened.

2 hours later, we had a meetup group, a Facebook page and plans for the first ever CSS meetup in Singapore.
