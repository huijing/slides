    <meta name="description" content="In the grand scheme of things, digital is still relatively new, compared to thousands of years of design on analogue mediums. The web as a medium has reached a new stage of maturity that allows us to translate designs from traditional mediums like print, onto the dynamic web. Hence, layouts no longer have to only run from top-to-bottom, left-to-right. Modern CSS provides new tools that allow us to explore and create designs that break out from cookie cutter layouts.">

The scope is mind-blowing.”<br><small>—David Březina from <a href="https://qz.com/522079/the-long-incredibly-tortuous-and-fascinating-process-of-creating-a-chinese-font/">The long, incredibly tortuous, and fascinating process of creating a Chinese font</a></small></blockquote>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Chinese typefaces are extremely challenging to create, simply due to the volume of glyphs required. The average number of glyphs for a Chinese system font clocks in at around 35,000 glyphs, give or take a couple thousand.</p>
              <p>This quote is from an article on Quartz that covered the process of creating a Chinese font, and it's a pretty interesting read, which goes into how much effort is needed to design and create a Chinese typeface.</p>
              <p>For a typeface to be viably used as body copy, it will probably need a minimum coverage of around 7000 glyphs for simplified Chinese or around 13,000 for traditional Chinese. That's still a lot of glyphs, hence Chinese fonts are almost always designed by teams over a period of years.</p>

              <p>The web is less than 30 years old, and because it is a completely new medium, it's only natural that people try to reconcile it with something familiar, like print.</p>
              <p>However, there is an additional degree of separation between the creator and the final output. As such, we cannot have the same set of expectations when it comes to handling the web as a medium.</p>
              <p>This is a medium where you cannot directly manipulate the canvas, in this case, the viewport of the browser. Instead what we do, is write code as instructions to the browser, to tell them how we want our designs to be rendered.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>With the release of CSS grid last year, it seems that we've hit yet another milestone for web design. Jen Simmons, creator of the amazing series Layout Land, drew a parallel between the evolution from metal letterpress to photo-based paste-up, with this evolution from Floats to Grid.</p>
              <p>Modern CSS gives us a wider vocabulary with which to communicate with the browser, so we can leverage these new capabilities that browsers now have for better art direction, more creative layouts and fresher designs that break out of the cookie cutter moulds we're so used to seeing on the web.</p>

            <p>So you can treat this talk like a scouting report, where I profile some of the most promising players on team layout, and how they can work really well together to handle certain situations. But really, at the end of the day, it's up to you to try out various combinations to find a solution that best works for your use-case.</p>

              <p><code>text-combine-upright</code> is the property that addresses the issue of numerals and abbreviations in vertical text, by allowing us to fit them into the width of one character to be displayed upright.</p>
              <p>No browser supports the digits value yet, which allows us to dictate how many digits or letters are acceptable to be squeezed in. The range allowed is between 2 to 4 characters.</p>
              <p>For now, with the <code>all</code> value, there is no limit, so you use it on a long word like “Beethoven”, and the browser will squish all those letters into that single-character space.</p>

              <p>These pencils are a mix of vertical and horizontal, with different colours so you can tell which way they are being laid out. The cool thing about flexbox is that it can do space distribution and content alignment like nothing we've seen before.</p>
              <p>Flex children can be laid out in any flow direction, left, right, downwards or even upwards, if that's what you want. Display order can also be reversed or rearranged, though this does have accessibility implications and should be used with caution.</p>

              <p>Again, the code is abridged, but placement is a matter of defining which row and column you'd like your element to appear in. And how many grid cells you'd like it to take up. It is perfectly acceptable to have multiple elements occupy the same space on your grid.</p>
              <p>This demo was also an excuse to play with <code>blend-modes</code>. CSS blend-modes work the same way as in Photoshop, and I learned from Lea Verou last week that it was Adobe who proposed the specification for it.</p>

              <p>With feature queries, we don't have to revisit our code-base to rewrite things when a browser gets updated, because the code is not browser-specific, it's feature specific. Once a feature gets shipped, your design will be updated automatically.</p>
              <p>This example makes use of a combination of feature queries for both Grid and CSS Shapes. If you're on a legacy browser, you'll get a simpler design, but everything is still styled.</p>
              <p>For now, Firefox users don't get to see the CSS Shapes effect, but once they do, the layout will automatically look like the one Chrome users see at the moment.</p>

              <p>It used to be that a new feature or bug fix would take a long time to ship, and that was true in the earlier days, when browsers were updated maybe every 6 months. But these days, the upgrade cycle has shortened immensely.</p>
              <p>This probably isn't the best visualisation you've ever seen, but the point I'm trying to make here is that browsers are being updated fast and furious these days.</p>

              <p>It's so much easier to get enthusiastic about new CSS features these days because they ship and become widely supported so much quicker now. And the same goes for bug fixes.</p>
              <p>Every major browser engine has a pretty open process for raising bugs, and raising bugs for a particular feature sends a signal to browser vendors that developers want to use this feature. This encourages them to prioritise related bug fixes.</p>
              <p>It's a win for everyone. By taking the time to submit a bug report, you gain karma points, get your bugs fixed AND make the web better for all of us.</p>
